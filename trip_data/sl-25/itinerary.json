      "history": "<h6>Ancient and Colonial History</h6><ul><li><strong>Ancient Era:</strong> Colombo has been a port city for over 2,000 years. The city's strategic location along the Indian Ocean made it a vital trading hub. It was mentioned in ancient texts such as the Mahavamsa, a historical chronicle of Sri Lanka.</li><li><strong>Portuguese Period (1505–1658):</strong> The Portuguese were the first European colonizers to arrive in Sri Lanka, establishing their presence in Colombo in 1505. They built fortifications, which later became part of the city’s defenses. The Portuguese controlled much of the coastal areas until they were ousted by the Dutch.</li><li><strong>Dutch Period (1658–1796):</strong> The Dutch East India Company took control of Colombo in 1658. They expanded the fortifications and introduced new infrastructure, like canals, and began managing trade. The Dutch influence is still seen in Colombo’s architecture and street names.</li><li><strong>British Period (1796–1948):</strong> The British took control of Colombo in 1796 and eventually established it as the capital of British Ceylon. During British rule, Colombo underwent significant urbanization, including the development of public buildings, roads, and railways. The city became a key center for the British Empire’s maritime trade.</li></ul><h6>Post-Independence and Modern Day</h6><ul><li><strong>Independence:</strong> Sri Lanka gained independence from Britain in 1948, and Colombo remained the capital of the newly independent nation. It was a focal point for political and economic changes.</li><li><strong>Civil War (1983–2009):</strong> The Sri Lankan Civil War between the government and the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) had a profound impact on Colombo. The city, while largely unaffected by the fighting, experienced bombings and attacks during the conflict. In 2009, the civil war officially ended, and Colombo began recovering and rebuilding.</li><li><strong>Modern Growth:</strong> Today, Colombo is a bustling metropolis with a mix of colonial and modern architecture.</li></ul>",

While the hot sun makes carrying around an umbrella a must and the crows are a nuisance, it is still a beautiful place to relax, enjoy the beach and have meals. There is enough space to walk around, sit and even fly kites. During the kite season, the skies over Galle Face Green are hidden behind the colorful kites that bring joy to the young and old.
